# Install

Run `./setup install` to symlink config files to home. Run `./setup remove` to
remove created symlinks. Setup script will not overwrite existing config files
and will only remove symlinks pointing to these files.

Run `./gnome-setup` to configure GNOME.

Remember to also configure [vim](https://github.com/inrick/Vim-config/).
